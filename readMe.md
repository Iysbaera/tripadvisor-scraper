# TripAdvisor API/Scrapper
Get the data from TripAdvisor fast and simple. API is now available for restaurants and hotels.
It is suitable for such a use cases as getting reviews, emails, addresses, awards  and many more attributes of hotels and restaurants on TripAdvisor.
## Why ?
Since TripAdvisor does not provide any reasonable open API for 3rd parties, in Apify we decided to make our own!
```If you need the TripAdvisor data for analysis that does not comply with TripAdvisor Terms of Services or they API limits are to low```.
